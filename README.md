# ScEMLA
ScEMLA: Ensemble Machine Learning-Based Pre-Trained annotation Approach for scRNA-seq data using Gradient Boosting with Genetic Optimizer
 
This repository contains code for our BMC Bioinformatics paper on scRNA-seq annotation using an ensemble learning approach with genetic optimization for feature selection.

## Structure
- `src/`: Core pipeline modules
- `run_pipeline.py`: Main script to run the full annotation workflow
- `notebooks/`: Example usage and visualization
- `data/`: Sample input files
- `results/`: Output labels from annotation

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_pipeline.py
